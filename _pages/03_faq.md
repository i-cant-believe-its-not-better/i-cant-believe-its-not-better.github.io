# How do I participate?

We organize workshops and events and are hoping to expand to other forms of outreach.  You can get involved by submitting a workshop paper, reviewing, or speaking at an event.  Please check our website as we update it with upcoming events!

# Why should I attend your events?

Honest, transparent conversations about machine learning research practice are more needed than ever.  We want all reasearchers to openly participate in these discussions to improve scientific rigor in the field.

# Why should I submit to your workshop?

We strive to not only provide useful feedback during the review process, but also highlight the importance of negative results in strengthening collective knowledge within the field. We hope that all authors are able have positive exchanges with the ICINB community to further their works in progress.
