The goal of the Retrospectives is to encourage researchers to self-reflect about their own previous work, in the form of writing retrospectives. A retrospective is basically a blog posts where research critically analyze their past papers.

If you have a paper where, looking back, you think *"huh, there's a lot more I could say about that now"* ---  either you realized that your methodology was slightly flawed, or there's some results that took many tricks to work that you didn't fully specify, or there's new work that changes your intuition, or something else --- then consider writing a retrospective! We think it’s important for this knowledge to be out in the open; when a paper doesn’t accurately reflect the authors’ opinion about their work, other researchers may misunderstand the significance of the idea, or waste time building off of shaky results.

If you’re unsure about what a retrospective might look like, see [this explanation](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/how/) of what they could include, or some previous examples [here](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/published_retrospectives/index.html).

#### How to submit

Submissions to the Retrospectives workshop will be handled through OpenReview.

#### Reviewing criteria

While we will host any submitted retrospective on our ML Retrospectives site (so long as it is written by an author of the original paper and follows our [code of conduct](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/coc/)), for this ICML workshop we will be selecting for higher quality retrospectives that provide interesting insights, admissions, or new perspectives on old work. While there is no page limit for retrospectives, we encourage authors to be concise.

Submissions will be evaluated on the following criteria:
- Clarity of writing
- Vulnerability and honesty in discussion of original paper
- Quality of discussion of limitations, significance of new insights, and/or presentation of new results or figures
- Impact of original paper

We expect all submissions to be written clearly and honestly, and contain discussions of limitations or new perspectives on the original work. While the impact of the original paper will be considered, we also encourage retrospective submissions for papers with low impact / few citations.
