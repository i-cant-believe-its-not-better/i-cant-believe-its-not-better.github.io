desc_title: Retrospectives Workshop @ ICML 2020
description: A venue for self-reflection in machine learning research
---


The [ICML](https://icml.cc/) Retrospectives Workshop is about reflecting on machine learning research. This workshop builds upon the [NeurIPS 2019 Retrospectives Workshop](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2019/) and encourage the exploration of a new kind of scientific publication, called *retrospectives*.

In conjunction with [ICML](https://icml.cc/), the workshop will be held **virtually on July 17, 2020.**


### What is a retrospective?

A retrospective is written about a single paper, by that paper's author, and takes the form of an informal blog post. The purpose of a retrospective is to answer the question:

#### *“What should readers of this paper know now, that is not in the original publication?”*

The overarching goal of retrospectives is to do better science, increase the openness and accessibility of the machine learning field, and to show that **it’s okay to make mistakes**.
We are accompanying the workshop with the open-source release of a retrospectives platform on GitHub called [ML Retrospectives](https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/), which will host retrospective submissions going forward after ICML 2020.

### How do I submit?

We accept submissions through OpenReview. Submissions can be from any subfield of machine learning or related fields of interest to the ICML community.  The main goal of the workshop is to widen what is publishable in ML, and to introduce researchers to more public reflections of their work as part of an ongoing effort to disseminate scientific knowledge more effectively and openly.

**Submission Deadline: May 18, 2020**

Our CFP provides additional details on how to write and submit a retrospective.
