<!-- # NeurIPS 2020 "I Can't Believe It's Not Better!" (ICBINB) Workshop Schedule -->
Saturday, December 12th
<!-- Times are listed in Eastern Daylight Time -->

This workshop proposal is unique in its emphasis on the gap between theory and empirical results, and its goal to share methodological best practices in a community-building setting. Its focus on the probabilistic ML community will gather researchers that speak the same language and are able to combine knowledge in a modular way. This will allow for productive methodological feedback, targeted discussions, and constructive critiques through, e.g., poster and breakout sessions.

You can find the schedule below. All times are Eastern Standard Time (EST).
