<!-- # NeurIPS 2020 "I Can't Believe It's Not Better!" (ICBINB) Workshop Schedule -->
Saturday, December 12th
<!-- Times are listed in Eastern Daylight Time -->

This workshop proposal is unique in its emphasis on the gap between theory and empirical results, and its goal to share methodological best practices in a community-building setting. Its focus on the probabilistic ML community will gather researchers that speak the same language and are able to combine knowledge in a modular way. This will allow for productive methodological feedback, targeted discussions, and constructive critiques through, e.g., poster and breakout sessions.

You can find below a tentative schedule (exact times are susceptible to change and will be confirmed later on):

#### Planned activities and invited speakers

Our goal is to adapt the workshop format beyond traditional schemes to engage online attendees and prioritize creative discussions. We plan to include a breakout discussion in small groups on methodological practices via concrete use cases. These discussions will be moderated by senior researchers on topics such as how to design better toy experiments, how to recognize and circumvent dead-ends, or how to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. We will also host 5-6 invited talks and 5-6 contributed talks, and a panel where senior researchers will discuss their experiences on projects that “failed”, how they got stuck, and provide advice to junior researchers.
