# NeurIPS 2020 I can't Believe It is Not Better Workshop Schedule
Friday, December 11
<!-- Times are listed in Eastern Daylight Time -->

This workshop proposal is unique in its emphasis on the gap between theory and empirical results, and its goal to share methodological best practices in a community-building setting. Its focus on the probabilistic ML community will gather researchers that speak the same language and are able to combine knowledge in a modular way. This will allow for productive methodological feedback, targeted discussions, and constructive critiques through, e.g., poster and breakout sessions.

A tentative schedule is:
