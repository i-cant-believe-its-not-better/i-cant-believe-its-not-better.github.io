To adapt the workshop format to its virtual setting and prioritize creative discussions, we will have breakout discussions in small groups on [Gather Town](
https://gather.town/app/5163xhrHdSWrUZsG/ICBINB).

## What are breakouts?

A breakout is a 30min informal discussion that will take place on the official [Gather.Town](https://gather.town/app/5163xhrHdSWrUZsG/ICBINB). The goal of this session is to share experiences related to the selected topic, find common interests, identify challenges/opportunities for improvement,  and brainstorm about ways to improve the research process overall. Each breakout will be mmoderated by a senior researcher, and will focus on a different step in the modeling process:

| Topic         | Moderator |
| Crazy data        | [Stephanie Hyland](https://sthy.land/pages/bio.html) |
| Tricky priors         | [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) |
| Muddled models      | [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) |
| Bumpy inference  | [Francisco Ruiz](https://franrruiz.github.io/)  |
| Off metrics | [Tamara Broderick](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tbroderick/) |

If you want to participate in one of these sessions, you just have to go to the corresponding "carpet" in the virtual Gather.Town world. You will be able to listen if inside the carpet, and can always leave if needed. There is one whiteboard available in each breakout.

The topics are wide on purpose, so that participants have the freedom to lead the discussion to wherever they want. Here some ideas for discussion:

* Share experiences related to the topic
* What is the biggest challenge?
* Why is it difficult to fix?
* What should we be done differently?

And more generally:

* What are underappreciated concepts and ideas in ML?
* How do we encourage the sharing of negative results?
* Saving papers from the graveyard / norms and incentives in publication
